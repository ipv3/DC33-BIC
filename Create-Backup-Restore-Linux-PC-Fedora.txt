INTRODUCTION
============

Oftentimes, the most straight-forward platform for program development is Linux. We can find an old PC that works well with Linux, but then there is the "joy" of figuring out the OS install, and the hesitancy of losing the current OS environment. To address these concerns, this document walks us through a new OS install while creating a block-by-block backup copy of the current hard drive that can be restored later. And did I say that Linux is free???

With the advent of Linux Live images, we can boot off of a USB stick to play with an environment without installing the OS to the hard drive. The Live image gives us a flavor of the environment. Also, it provides tools for system administration. This includes tools to run a backup, a restore, and perform a checksum calculation of a file or hard drive to verify the integrity of a copy later.

PREREQUISITES
=============

Version tested: Fedora 38

- An Intel PC (but not a Chrome PC): minimum 2 GB RAM, preferably 4 GB or greater, minimum 32 GB disk,
preferably 64 GB or greater. If you need to back up the hard drive, the size should be preferably 512 GB or less (because the backup drive/file needs to be larger). Currently, Linux has been seen to run reliably on systems that might be below the official minimum specs for RAM, processor cores, or speed 
- IF YOU CANNOT USE THE DESTINATION PC TO DOWNLOAD AND SAVE THE OS IMAGE (e.g. you're installing on a new PC and you want to back up the disk image for later use): A Windows/Mac/Linux PC with minimum 3 GB disk free, at least 1 available USB drive slot, and Internet connectivity
- The ability to set the BIOS to boot from a USB drive before the PC boots from its hard drive
- A USB flash drive 4 GB or greater to hold the Fedora Live bootable image. I recommend USB 3.0 or faster
- IF YOU NEED TO BACK UP THE EXISTING HARD DRIVE OF DESTINATION PC: That PC must have at least 2 USB slots (of the proper size) to perform a backup of the PC disk drive
- IF YOU NEED TO BACK UP THE EXISTING HARD DRIVE OF DESTINATION PC: A USB flash drive OR external hard drive that is larger than the PC disk drive.  I recommend USB 3.0 or faster (Note: The size of the backup file can be less than the hard drive of the destination PC if optional compression is used)
- If plugging in 2 USB Flash drives at the same time, check to make sure the slots are not too close. On some systems the slots are two close for 2 USB Flash drives side by side (this issue has been observed on an HP laptop)
- Camera/cameraphone to document a few settings
- Internet connectivity (get the Wi-Fi password if it is a protected network)




DOWNLOAD MEDIA WRITER, OS IMAGE; MAKE BOOTABLE LIVE USB
=======================================================
 Approximate Time: 1 hour

Download Media Writer and Fedora Live Boot USB Image
----------------------------------------------------
 1. Create a directory under C:\  such as C:\Fedora-Download

 2. Go to Fedora Workstation Download Page:
    https://www.fedoraproject.org/workstation/download/

 3. Download:  Fedora Media Writer

 4. Cut/Paste the Writer executable program to:  C:\Fedora-Download

For guidance, review the "Learn More" documentation for Fedora Media Writer:
https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/latest/preparing-boot-media/#_fedora_media_writer


 5. Download:  Fedora Workstation 38  |  Live ISO  |  For Intel and AMD x86_64 systems

 6. Cut/Paste the Live ISO image to C:\Fedora-Download

For installation guidance, review the "Learn More" documentation for Fedora Media Writer:
https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/creating-and-using-a-live-installation-image/


Install/Run Fedora Media Writer
-----------------------
 7. Go to program file on disk (in C:\Fedora-Download). Run the program (click or double-click)
        Allow it to make changes on the computer
        Agree to the License
        Note the location of the destination folder
        Click: Install
        Click: Next
        Click: Finish

 8. By default, Fedora Media Writer will run after the installation
        Insert a SPARE USB drive that WILL BE OVERWRITTEN. tHE DRIVE SHOULD BE 4 GB or greater
        Select image source: Select .iso file
        Select the ISO file on disk (in C:\Fedora-Download)
        Select the destination USB stick (it might be preselected)
        Continue the process
    Note: You might receive several messages from Windows that you need to format a drive.  Just Cancel these

        When the process is done, click: Finish
        Fedora Media Writer takes you back to Select Image Source.  Select X (cancel at top of box)

 9. Unmount the USB drive & remove, or shut down the PC / power off the PC and remove the USB drive

10. Affix a label to the USB drive as "Fedora nn Live Boot" or find a closable sandwich bag and label




BOOT PC FROM FEDORA LIVE BOOT USB
=================================
 Approximate Time: 30 minutes (longer to learn skills in Step 5)

 1. With the PC off, insert the USB drive

 2. Set the USB drive (perhaps USB HDD) so that it boots before the regular Hard drive
    Note:  There is a good chance that you might need to go into the BIOS settings to change the boot order
    After power-on you Might need to press ENTER, F12, F10 , F2, F1, DEL, possibly F4, or some other function key to enter the BIOS Setup menu or Boot menu.  There might or might not be guidance displayed on the screen after power on.

 3. Power on the PC and boot from the USB drive
    Boot menu:
        Start Fedora-Live-Workstation-nn

 4. On the welcome screen you are prompted whether you want to install Fedora. Choose: Not Now

 5. Explore your Live Boot OS or search the Internet to learn the following tasks/skills:
    - Connect PC to WiFi/Internet
    - Start a CLI window
    - In CLI, basic command entry and command completion (Tab key)
    - Start the Internet browser (Firefox)
    - Shut down Fedora




Optional: BACK UP THE HARD DRIVE
================================
 Approximate Time: 1 hour (up to 3+ hours for larger hard drives and/or compression)

 1. WITH THE COMPUTER OFF, plug in the Fedora Live USB. Also, plug in the USB drive or external hard drive cable where the backup image will be written

 2. Boot Computer from the Fedora Live USB
On the welcome screen you are prompted whether you want to install Fedora. Choose: Not Now

 3. Run the cmd prompt


Determine the device name of the drive to back up, and the destination drive
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

It will be good if you know the approximate size of the drive to make it easier to identify

 5. Look for the source drive; the drive that is to be backed up / duplicated / copied 
        Type:
            su
            fdisk -l
            - or -
            parted -l

        Keep in mind that a drive can have several partitions. You NEED to back up the entire drive with all the partitions.  (This bears usefulness to repeat: usually you want to back up ALL of your primary hard drive; not just the partition that holds the majority of your stuff. You need ALL of the hard drive that includes the Boot Loader, Microsoft Windows Recovery partition, etc, etc.)

        Examples:
            /dev/sda
            /dev/sdb
            /dev/mmcblk0   (often seen with partitions p1 through p3 or p4)

 6. Identify the destination/target drive AND mounted directory path; where the copy will be written   
    (a) Type:
            su
            fdisk -l
            - or -
            parted -l

    (b) then:  df -h
            This command makes it easier to see if your target drive is mounted (and where)

        Usually, USB drives and external drives are formatted for Windows.  Linux can read them

        Note: The PC hard drive should be unmounted and not appearing with the df -h command. Normally this is the default when using the Live image


Back Up the Drive Using the dd Linux Utility
--------------------------------------------
 7. Run a cmd prompt

 8. Type:
        su  (if not superuser already)
        dd  if=/dev/xxxxxx  of=/<filepath>/<filename>
        Example:  dd if=/dev/mmcblk0   of=/run/media/liveuser/Seagate\ Backup\ Plus\ Drive/pc2-disk-image-Aug-25-2023.img

Because the path of the output file is so long AND this disk drive name contains spaces, an easier way to do this is to go to this longer directory and then only have to enter the ending filename. Using [Tab] completion, this process becomes:
    cd /run/media [Tab] [Tab] [Tab] [Enter]    (assumes media and liveuser have no additional files)
       -followed by the command -
    pwd      (to see that you are there)
        -and-
    dd if=/dev/mmcblk0   of=pc2-disk-image-Aug-25-2023.img

    Write down this command and save it for when you need to restore the image    


    Note: A little lesson about spaces in filenames in Linux:: In Linux, directory names and file names become "interesting" if they have spaces. Linux handles them, but Linux users often make their lives easier by using dashes or underscores instead of spaces. In the example above we see backslashes used. They are NOT in the directory name, but are used to make an "escape sequence" for a space. The following example might help. We can use:
cd Seagate\ Backup\ Plus\ Drive    -or-  cd 'Seagate Backup Plus Drive'
The external drive has spaces in its name because it is formatted for... ... Windows.

    Note: This process might take 10 minutes to an hour or more.  The entire contents of the drive are read and copied. Also, a backup versus a restore might take a significantly *different* amount of time. (With 64 GB eMMC (Flash memory) hard drive PC a backup takes about 10 minutes but a restore takes around 90 minutes). Normally, the dd command does not provide any feedback until it ends. While waiting, the screen will go dark in 5 or 10 minutes without any keyboard/mouse input. Just press the SHIFT key to display the screen.

    NOTE: The input file (if=) is the PC internal hard drive, it is usually NOT mounted by Linux during the Live boot; this is good because it probably should not be mounted during this copy operation. The command might complain if the input file (if=) is mounted. On the other hand, the destination drive needs to be mounted with a file path to the directory where you plan to write. In the current Live version of Fedora, the destination drive is mounted automatically *IF* it is plugged in when the Live image is booted. As we see here, Fedora mounted the external drive at /run/media/liveuser/Seagate Backup Plus Drive.  We can see this readily with the  df -h  command; it shows us that Fedora mounted the /dev/sda1 filesystem (containing a 1.9TB drive) on the mount point /run/media/liveuser/Seagate Backup Plus Drive.

    Note: It is recommended that you make a second copy on another USB drive or external hard drive

 9. Optional Highly Recommended Step: Upon command completion, Capture the blocks copied with a picture or other method

10. Write down the command you used to back up the drive. Store this note with the drive


Optional Highly Recommended: For integrity, compute a checksum for the backup file
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. Type an appropriate command to compute a checksum of the file
        md5sum  /<filepath>/<filename>
        Example:  md5sum  /run/media/liveuser/Seagate Backup Plus Drive/pc2-disk-image-Aug-25-2023.img
                    -or-
                sha256sum /run/media/liveuser/Seagate Backup Plus Drive/pc2-disk-image-Aug-25-2023.img

    At least five checksum utility programs are available on the Live USB: sum, md5sum, sha1sum, sha256sum, and sha512sum. Of these, md5sum and sha256sum might appear to be used more frequently.

    Note:  This will take a while.  The hard drive back-up image is a very large file

    Note:  If you run the (same) checksum program over the input disk drive, the program should compute the same value as the backup file. Of course, this will take a while to run
           e.g.:  sha256sum  /dev/mmcblk0

12. Capture the checksum value with a picture or other method


Finishing Steps
---------------
13. Shut down the PC, power off the PC, and remove the USB drive where you wrote the backup file

14. Affix a label to the USB drive such as "MyPC HD Image 1 mm-dd-yyyy" or find a closable sandwich bag and label


Optional:  Back Up Using gzip Compression
-----------------------------------------
 1. Type:
        su  (if not superuser already)
        dd  if=/dev/xxxxxx | gzip -c  >  /<filepath>/<filename>
        Example:  dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 | gzip -c > /run/media/liveuser/Seagate\ Backup\ Plus\ Drive/pc2-disk-image-Aug-25-2023.img.gzip
                        -or-
                  cd   /run/media/liveuser/Seagate\ Backup\ Plus\ Drive    (change to dest directory)
                  dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 | gzip -c > pc2-disk-image-Aug-25-2023.img.gzip

    This will take notably longer than a backup without compression. In my lightly used system with a 64 GB disk, the gzipped backup was about 7 GB; 11 percent of the original size. 




INSTALL FEDORA LINUX ON YOUR PC
===============================
 Approximate Time: 1 hour

Version tested: Fedora 38

 1. Boot Computer from the USB

 2. Get on Wi-Fi and the Internet

    Note: This will take about 10 minutes
    A message should display that Fedora is ready.
    Click: Finish Installation

 5. Power off the PC

 6. Remove the Live USB

 7. Power on the system

 8. Follow this set of prompts
    "Setup / Welcome to Fedora Linux nn"
    Click: Start Setup

    "Privacy"
    Select the options as you choose
    Click: Next

    Third-Part Repositories"
    By default, this is enabled
    Click: Next

    "Connect Your Online Accounts"
    Choose accounts or click Skip

    "About You"
    Full Name / Username   
    Enter a name          (I prefer to enter a short username instead of a long full name)
    Click: Next

    "Pasword"
    Enter and Confirm a password
    (Note: Remember your username and password!!!  Write it down in a secure place.)

    "Setup Complete"
    Click: Start Using Fedora Linux

    "Welcome to GNOME"
    No Thanks / Take Tour
    Click: No Thanks


Optional: Regarding the root password
In this procedure the password that is set is for our regular user account is a portion of the installation process.  Unix/Linux systems use an account named "root" for system and administrative processes. It is possible to administer some aspects of a system without knowing the root password. Upon installation, our user is added to a role called "sudo" tht allows us to run administrative system commands by confirming our own regular user password.
Example:
    sudo less /var/log/anaconda/anaconda.log
This command grants a super-user privilege to run the less/more command to read an installation log that is a protected system file.

Although it is sometimes not recommended, some system owners desire to set and have the root password. If this is desired, the following command allows a regular user with sudo privileges to set the root password:
    sudo passwd root

Be sure to protect this credentially properly.  Also, if additional users are added to your system, be sure to regulate the users who have sudo privileges. sudo permissions are configured in file /etc/sudoers. In this file, we see a setup for users who are in a group that is named "wheel". We look at the file named /etc/group and see that our regular account is added to the entry for the "wheel" group. Naturally we need to exercise due care and due dilligence for the users who are added to the "wheel" group entry.

Optional: RESTORE HARD DRIVE FROM BACKUP IMAGE
==============================================
 Approximate Time: 1 hour (up to 5+ hours for larger hard drives and/or compression)

Note:  This process DESTROYS your Linux (or other OS) installation on the PC. BEFORE performing these instructions, be sure to back up your hard drive if you want to retain it for later use.

Be sure that your PC is set to boot from a USB drive.  For more information, see the section: BOOT PC FROM FEDORA LIVE BOOT USB

Boot PC from Linux Live USB
---------------------------
 1. WITH THE COMPUTER OFF, plug in the Fedora Live USB. Also, plug in the USB drive or external hard drive cable that contains the drive image that is to be restored

 2. Boot Computer from the Fedora Live USB
On the welcome screen you are prompted whether you want to install Fedora. Choose: Not Now

3. Run the cmd prompt


Find Your Drives
----------------
 4. Determine the device names of the USB drive / external drive containing the backup image, and the interal hard drive to be overwritten

    It will be good to know the approximate sizes of these drives to make them easier to identify
    Type:
        su
        fdisk -l
         --optionally you can use ... --
        parted -l

    then:  df -h
        This command makes it easier to see if your backup drive is mounted (and where)

 5. Look for the drives. You NEED to restore the entire drive with all of its partitions.  Examples:
    /dev/sda
    /dev/mmcblk0   
 
    If you wrote down the command you used to back up the drive, you can refer to it. Often, the restore command is a simple reversal of the input and output. But use the  fdisk -l  and  df -h  commands to verify


Restore the Hard Drive Using the dd Linux Utility
-------------------------------------------------
 6. dd  if=/<filepath/<filename>  of=/dev/xxxxxx
    Example:  dd if=/run/media/liveuser/Seagate Backup Plus Drive/pc2-disk-image-Aug-25-2023.img of=/dev/mmcblk0

    Note: This process might take an hour or more.  The entire contents of the backup file are read and copied to the hard drive
    If you captured the blocks copied with a picture or other method, you can compare this upon the completion of the command

 7. Optional Highly Recommended Step: For integrity, compute a checksum for the restored drive

    Use the SAME checksum program that was used during the backup procedure
        md5sum    /dev/<device>
        sha256sum /dev/<device>
        Example:  md5sum    /dev/mmcblk0
                    -or-
                  sha256sum /dev/mmcblk0

 8. Optional Highly Recommended Step: Upon command completion, Capture the checksum with a picture or other method

 9. Shut down the PC

10. Remove the USB drives

11. Boot the PC to test the restored operating system


Optional:  Restore Backup That Uses gzip Compression
-----------------------------------------------------
 1. Type:
        su  (if not superuser already)
        gunzip -c /<filepath>/<filename> |  dd  of=/dev/xxxxxx  
        Example:  gunzip -c /run/media/liveuser/Seagate\ Backup\ Plus\ Drive/pc2-disk-image-Aug-25-2023.img.gzip  | dd of=/dev/mmcblk0 
                        -or-
                  cd   /run/media/liveuser/Seagate\ Backup\ Plus\ Drive    (change to source directory)
                  gunzip -c pc2-disk-image-Aug-25-2023.img.gzip | dd of=/dev/mmcblk0
